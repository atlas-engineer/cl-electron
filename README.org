#+TITLE: cl-electron - Electron binding for Common Lisp

* Installation
=cl-electron= depends on Electron, NodeJS, a Common Lisp implementation
(SBCL) and some CL libraries (consult [[file:cl-electron.asd][cl-electron.asd file]]).

** Nix + Quicklisp
Issuing =nix-shell= at the root of the project starts an environment
where all dependencies are available expect for the CL libraries.

If you manage CL libraries by yourself, place them in a directory where
ASDF finds them (e.g. =~/common-lisp/=).

If you manage Common Lisp dependencies with Quicklisp:

1. Clone the git repository to =~/common-lisp/quicklisp/local-projects/cl-electron=
2. =sbcl=
3. =(ql:quickload :cl-electron)=

** Guix
The official Guix channel doesn't provide Electron.  Packing it from
source might be a non-trivial task.

Installing Electron as binary is acceptable for non official Guix
channels, such as [[https://gitlab.com/nonguix/nonguix][nonguix]].  For the time being, an experimental Electron
package is hosted [[https://gitlab.com/aadcg/nonguix][at a nonguix channel fork]].

Clone it by issuing =git clone https://gitlab.com/aadcg/nonguix.git=.

Add it as a local Guix channel by editing the file
=~/.config/guix/channels.scm=, along the lines of the example below.

#+begin_src scheme
(cons* (channel
        (name 'nonguix-local)
        (url "/path/to/nonguix/checkout")
        (branch "nyxt-electron-wip"))
       %default-channels)
#+end_src

At last, issue =guix pull= so that the new Electron package can be
found.  You need to manually pull from the relevant branch to get
channel updates.

Once the above preliminaries are complete, start a REPL will all the
dependencies by issuing:

=guix shell -D -f /path/to/guix.scm -- sbcl=.

*Note:* You need to either (1) add Electron's binary to your PATH,
located at "/gnu/store/HASH-electron-24.2.0/electron"; (2) patch
=launch= to set the binary's full path.  This is current limitation of
the Electron package.

* Example
In the example below we launch Electron to create a window that handles
on key press events.

#+begin_src lisp
(asdf:load-system :cl-electron)
(in-package :cl-electron)
(launch)
(register-before-input-event
 (make-instance 'browser-window)
 (lambda (browser-window input) (print input)))
#+end_src
